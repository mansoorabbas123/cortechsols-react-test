**Description:**

This is a React application built with Vite that implements basic e-commerce functionalities. Users can register, login, view products, add items to their cart, adjust quantities, and checkout using Stripe (simulated).

**Features:**

-   User registration and login
-   Product browsing
-   Cart management (add, remove, quantity adjustment)
-   Checkout simulation with Stripe (frontend-only)

**Project Setup:**

1.  Clone the repository.
    
2.  Install dependencies:
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    npm install
    
    ```
    
    Use code [with caution.](/faq#coding)
    
3.  Run the development server:
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    npm run dev
    
    ```
    
    Use code [with caution.](/faq#coding)
    

**Application Usage:**

1.  **Initial Access:** Upon first visit, shop routes are private and require registration and login.
2.  **Registration:** Create a new account with your desired credentials.
3.  **Login:** Use your registered email and password to log in.
    -   A token is generated on the frontend and stored in local storage for session persistence.
4.  **Shop:** After successful login, you can access product listings, add items to your cart, and checkout.
5.  **Checkout:** Make a transaction using stripe.
6.  **Logout:** Clicking "Logout" removes the user token from local storage.
    -   Subsequent visits require login again.

**Technical Details:**

-   Built with Typescript React and Vite for a fast and efficient development experience.
-   Local storage is used for user credentials and session management (simulated backend).
-   Frontend token generation for session persistence.
-   Stripe integration is simulated for checkout functionality (no actual backend connection).

**Disclaimer:**

This application is for demonstration purposes only. A real-world e-commerce application would require a secure backend for user data management, authentication, and payment processing.
